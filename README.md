# 🎬 StreamSync

**Watch videos together, perfectly in sync.** StreamSync is a Chrome extension that synchronizes video playback across multiple browsers in real-time — so you and your friends can watch movies, shows, and anime together no matter where you are.

> No more counting down "3… 2… 1… play." Just press play.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time Video Sync** — Play, pause, and seek are instantly mirrored across all users in the room.
- **Universal Compatibility** — Works on YouTube, Crunchyroll, and any website with an HTML5 video player.
- **Built-in Chat** — Talk with your friends without leaving the browser.
- **Room System** — Create or join rooms with simple Room IDs. Share the code and you're watching together.
- **Host Controls** — The room creator is the Host. Only the Host can change the video URL for everyone.
- **Ad-Aware Syncing** — Automatically detects YouTube ads, pauses sync for the room, and resumes when the ad ends.
- **Customizable Settings** — Light/Dark theme, accent colors, chat text size, audio alerts, and Do Not Disturb mode.
- **Room Settings (Host)** — Adjust sync sensitivity, enable Strict Mode (host-only playback control), and toggle auto-pause on buffering.
- **Firebase Authentication** — Secure login via Email/Password or Google Sign-In, with email verification.
- **Username System** — Choose a display name with a 3-day change cooldown enforced via Firestore.

## 🏗️ Architecture

StreamSync uses a **client-server model** powered by WebSockets:

```
Browser Extension (Client)  ←→  Node.js + Socket.io (Server)  ←→  Other Clients
         ↕
   Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
```

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Extension | Chrome Manifest V3, Side Panel API |
| Real-time Sync | Socket.io (WebSockets) |
| Server | Node.js + Express |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth (Email + Google) |
| Rate Limiting | Cloud Firestore |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS with CSS Variables (Theming Engine) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### 2. Load the Extension
1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load Unpacked** → Select the `extension/` folder

### 3. Watch Together
1. Open any video in your browser
2. Click the StreamSync icon to open the Side Panel
3. Sign in or create an account
4. Enter a **Room ID** and click **Join Room**
5. Share the Room ID with your friends — that's it!

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Firebase Setup
You'll need your own Firebase project. Update `extension/firebase-config.js` with your credentials:
- Enable **Email/Password** and **Google** sign-in providers in Firebase Console
- Add your Chrome extension ID to authorized domains
- Create a Firestore database (for username rate-limiting)

### Server Deployment
The Socket.io server can be hosted on any Node.js-compatible platform:
- **Free:** Render, Fly.io, Koyeb, AWS EC2 Free Tier
- **Cheap:** Vultr ($3.50/mo), AWS Lightsail ($3.50/mo), Railway ($5/mo)
